\subsection{Shocks}

Shocks, or in more technical terms singular compression waves, are escalating
highly localized spikes in density and pressure due to nonlinear dynamics
encoded in the Euler equation. When a shock wave is emerging the velocity
behind the wave front is higher than in front of it. The media gets highly
compressed untill an unphysical state is reached. The velocity characteristica
begin to cross. Nature solves this dilemma by introducing additional physics
like extreme heat radiation, explosions, bangs or detachement of media in case
of surface waves. Either way, it involves an entropy increase in the system.
A numerical solver has to capture this kind of physics in order no to crash and
notably to be accurate.
