\section{Conclusion}

This document shows the correctness and stability of the current transformation
scheme from FLASH (BCG) to FLEXI (GNG/LNG) and back to BCG for various setups.
Shocks do not get resolved very well due to extrapolation errors inherent to
the Lagrange interpolation.

Smooth or not too harsh setups are transformed up to machine precision.
