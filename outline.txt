1. Introduction
    - what, why and how?

2. Theory
    - euler, navierstokes and mhd equations
    - compressible supersonic turbulences, shocks
    - statistics about turbulences
    - creating turbulences, OU-process strirring
    - FV methods, Bouchut solver
    - DG methods, Flexi, shock capturing, shock indicators

3. Setup / Simulation
    - very brief about Flash and Flexi
    - periodic box, grid, grid spaces, nodes
    - initial setup: why and how
    - fixed quantities: box size, crossing time, etc.
    - expectations, envisaged results

4. Discussion
    - flash vs flexi
    - decaying turb. vs forced turb.
    - spectras, time series, QR plots, ...

5. Conclusion
    - happy or sad, expectations vs reality
    - problems, fallacies, pitfalls
    - what could be done next?
